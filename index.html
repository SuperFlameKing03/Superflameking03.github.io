        <p>A long, long time ago in a far distant land a great terror fell from the sky. Retaliating in fear, the people fled from their land in search for a new home, protected by a legendary beast from their homeland. They eventually found a new land to settle in, but little did these newcomers realize that they were not the first to try and settle here. At first they tried to make peace, but could not get along, as the ideals of the natives were very different from the ideals of the newcomers. Upon witnessing the ancient guardian of these lands, the newcomers began to fear a repeat of the events back in their homeland known as "The Darkest Day." Eventually, tensions reached an all time high and the two legendary guardians clashed for territory. This dragged the newcomers and the natives into the conflict, which became all out war. When all seemed lost for both sides, a White Pikachu decended from the heavens and sealed away both legendary beasts. It's been 100 Years since these events have taken place, and we are only now truly beginning to recover. The newcomers and natives nowadays are striving even more than ever before for unity and peace. But no one knows if the tales about these legendary guardians or even a White Pikahcu are true or exagerated belief.</p>
